# Browser voice evaluation run sheet

Use this sheet to compare browser-provided speech features on the same device and phrases. It is a small manual check, not a representative benchmark.

## Record the setup

- Date and time:
- Browser and version:
- Operating system and device:
- Network state:
- Speech language selected in BolPrep:
- TTS provider and voice selected (browser or streamed OpenAI voice):
- Installed TTS voice selected (name and locale):
- Browser-provided STT available:

Do not record or upload learner audio for this run. The app keeps timing summaries in page memory and does not retain transcript text in those metrics. Expand **Speech diagnostics** and use **Copy JSON** or **Download JSON** to export grouped timing and failure counts; the export contains no transcript text or audio and clears on reload.

## TTS checks

Use **Preview** for the fixed English phrase. For Hindi and Hinglish, run BolPrep without an API key, ask the corresponding fixed offline question in the STT table, and repeat the same answer at least ten times. To compare streamed speech, configure the server API key, enable **Use experimental streamed OpenAI speech**, choose a provider voice, and repeat the same phrase; each streamed attempt may incur API usage. The [official TTS guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/text-to-speech) lists the 13 available voices and notes they are optimized for English. Keep the browser, device, provider, voice, language, and question/answer the same within a comparison. Reloading the page clears the timing samples. Since Hindi/Hinglish samples use tutor answers while English uses Preview, compare p50/p95 only within the same sample type.

| Language | TTS phrase / question | Intelligibility (1-5) | Pronunciation (1-5) | Naturalness (1-5) | Notes / failures |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Hindi | Use Hindi STT prompt below; listen to the offline tutor answer. | | | | |
| Hinglish | Use Hinglish STT prompt below; listen to the offline tutor answer. | | | | |
| English | Hello, let's study fundamental rights together. | | | | |

From the copied JSON `tts` entries, transfer `start_delay.p50_s` / `start_delay.p95_s` and `playback_duration.p50_s` / `playback_duration.p95_s` into the matching language, voice, and sample-type row (Preview or tutor answer). Streamed runs are labeled `OpenAI coral`. Check `start_event`: browser timings begin at the synthesis `onstart` event, while streamed timings begin when the first PCM buffer is scheduled; neither is an acoustic measurement. Use the end-to-end stopwatch below for first-audible timing. `completed_count` is Runs; `failure_count` is Failures. A `null` timing means no successful playback was recorded for that group.

| Language / voice | Sample type | Runs | Start p50 / p95 (s) | Playback p50 / p95 (s) | Failures |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| | | | | | |

## STT checks

Read each prompt once at a natural pace. Compare the recognized text with the reference and note omitted, substituted, or extra words. Repeat at least ten times per language before interpreting the displayed latency p50/p95.

| Language | Reference prompt | Recognized text | Exact match? | Error notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hindi | अनुच्छेद 14 में समानता के दो विचार क्या हैं? | | | |
| Hinglish | Article 14 mein equality ke do ideas kya hain? | | | |
| English | What two ideas does Article 14 protect? | | | |

From the copied JSON `stt` entries, transfer `time_to_first_final.p50_s` / `time_to_first_final.p95_s` by language. `final_transcript_count` is Runs; `failed_or_empty_count` is Failed / empty results. A `null` timing means no successful final transcript was recorded for that language.

| Language / STT locale | Runs | First-final p50 / p95 (s) | Failed / empty results | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| | | | | |

## End-to-end voice trial record

Use a fixed, self-authored practice question for each language. For every attempt, compare the recognized transcript with what you said, then check the answer against the displayed study source. When a spoken answer is produced, use a stopwatch to time from the end of your spoken question to the first audible tutor sound; record seconds to one decimal place. Start timing when you finish speaking, not when the final transcript appears. Mark unavailable if either endpoint cannot be observed, and do not infer success from a later stage.

| Language | Trial | Intended question | Transcript usable? | Source shown and relevant? | Answer supported by source? | Spoken answer completed? | Speech-end to first-audio (s) | Failure stage / notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| | 1 | | | | | | | |
| | 2 | | | | | | | |
| | 3 | | | | | | | |

For transcript usability, record whether the meaning and any named article number survived recognition; exact wording is not required. For source relevance and answer support, cite the article shown and note any claim that the source does not support. The stopwatch value is a coarse end-to-end observation for that attempt; it includes browser recognition, tutor response, and speech startup, so do not add it to the UI's STT or TTS timings. Keep these observations separate from listener ratings above. This small manual record does not measure population-level accuracy.
## Report carefully

- Include browser, device, selected voice/locale, sample phrase, run count, and failures with any results.
- The UI reports browser event timings, not end-to-end model latency. It does not measure speech quality automatically.
- Listener ratings are subjective. Record them with the rater's consent; do not treat one person's ratings as a general result.
- Never describe these small manual samples as production, learner, or population-level benchmarks.

## Turn-taking and interruption checks

Run these checks in a browser with speech playback available. Use the same browser, device, language, and answer for each repetition. Repeat each case at least five times; record each attempt as pass, fail, or not available. Do not use real learner recordings.

1. Start a tutor answer and press **Stop** while it is speaking. Record whether audio stops promptly and whether the status remains stopped.
2. Start another answer and press **Speak** while it is speaking. Record whether old audio stops, the recognized text stays editable, and no old speech resumes after recognition ends.
3. Stop a tutor request while it is still thinking, then send a follow-up about the same topic. Record whether the interrupted question remains in the conversation context and whether any late answer appears after the follow-up.
4. Let a long answer finish, then ask a follow-up question. Record whether the follow-up is answered without old audio restarting.
5. Start microphone capture, press **Stop**, then start a fresh capture and speak a different question. Record whether any late result from the stopped capture changes the fresh transcript or status. If the browser does not deliver delayed recognition events, mark this case unavailable rather than assuming stale-event handling passed.
6. With experimental streamed speech enabled, start a tutor answer and press **Stop** while its audio is arriving or playing. Start a new answer immediately. Record whether the old audio stops and stays stopped, with no late chunk playing over the new turn. Note the selected streamed voice; each attempt may incur API usage. If no API key or supported audio browser is available, mark this case unavailable.

| Case | Attempts | Passes | Failures / unavailable | Browser event or visible symptom |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Stop during playback | | | | |
| Start microphone during playback | | | | |
| Stop while thinking, then follow up | | | | |
| Follow up after completed answer | | | | |
| Stop and restart microphone capture | | | | |
| Interrupt streamed speech, then start a new turn | | | | |

For each attempt, add one row below before summarizing the totals above. Keep the browser, device, language, and answer fixed across repetitions; if any setting changes, start a separate run sheet. Use the visible browser status or event as the observation, and mark unsupported browser behavior as unavailable rather than pass or fail.

| Case | Trial | Outcome (pass / fail / unavailable) | Browser event or visible symptom |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| | 1 | | |
| | 2 | | |
| | 3 | | |
| | 4 | | |
| | 5 | | |

This is a manual interaction check, not provider cancellation proof. The local client can abort its request and ignore stale client events, but the model provider may continue generating after the browser stops waiting.
